# A C# console application designed to manage a list of bands and their respective ratings, now in OOP.

## 📖 Description

In the first project, the focus was on creating a basic application, where I learned the fundamental concepts of the C# language, following the structured programming paradigm. In the current project, there was significant progress, as I now applied the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

In this course, OOP was implemented through the creation of classes such as Band and Album, which encapsulate related data and behaviors, providing a clearer and more modular code structure. The properties of these classes store relevant information and are accessed in a controlled manner, ensuring data encapsulation and security.

Additionally, methods were implemented to perform specific operations, such as registering bands and calculating averages, emphasizing object interaction and system modularity. The use of collections, such as Dictionary<string, Band>, demonstrates the combination of OOP with data structures, enabling efficient management of object groups. As a result, the application has become more dynamic, scalable, and well-structured.

As I’ve already mentioned, the goal of this profile is to share and track my evolution over the coming months and years. I know this is still a simple project, but for someone who, just three weeks ago, didn’t even know what an object, a class, encapsulation, or inheritance was, I’m really happy with my recent progress and the effort I’ve put into this project.

You'll notice that the interface hasn't changed much (just the background wallpaper, haha), but if you take a look at this code and compare it with the previous one, you'll see significant differences in its structure.
